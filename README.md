A Spot where you can find any of the code from Black Hat programming books from No Starch Press.

Starting with the Black Hat Python Programming book and will eventually add the Go Lang code into here as well.

This is so that if you need something from the books quickly, you can grab it from here and tweak what ever it is you need.
